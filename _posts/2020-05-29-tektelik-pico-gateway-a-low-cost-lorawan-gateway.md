Today I come to talk to you about what it is my mains home LoRaWAN gateway right now, the Tektelic Pico (also called [Tektelic KONA Micro Lite](https://tektelic.com/wp-content/uploads/KONA-Micro-Lite.pdf), as it is a light version of the [Tektelic KONA Micro](https://tektelic.com/wp-content/uploads/KONA-Micro.pdf)). This is the cheapest option available from Tektelic right now. I purchased some months ago at [The Things Conference](https://www.thethingsnetwork.org/conference/) so I have been able to test it for quite some time. 

[Tektelic Communications](https://tektelic.com/) is a Canadian company that is is one of the biggest suppliers of LoRaWAN IoT products right now. It not only supplies ones of the best (and most expensive) gateways on the market but it also provides sensors and custom applications. So it is a well reputed company on the LoRaWAN IoT sector.
